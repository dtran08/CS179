CS 193: Design Project
Spring 2019
Instructor: Christian Shelton

Syllabus
--------

This offering of CS 193 focuses on the design and implementation of
visualization software for medical databases.  The final project will
consist of 1) software to allow for the visualization of collections
of medical records, particularly from intensive care units, and 2)
documentation of the software for users of the software and programmers
who might extend the software.

The week-by-week schedule is planned to be as follows.

Week 1-2: Research and review of existing visualization software*
	   Selection of a framework/platform to build on
Week 3: Identification of type of visualization desired.
	      Mock-up of desired tool.*
Week 4-6: Initial implementation
Week 7: Demonstration of first version*
Week 8-9: Generation of final version
		Writing of documentation
Week 10: Review and final feedback on software and documentation
Finals Week: Demonstration and full review of software and documentation*

Items with *s will be graded, with the following weights toward the final grade:

Existing tool research: 15%
Mock-up: 15%
First version: 20%
Final documentation: 20%
Final version: 30%

Time will be spent in (a) weekly one-on-one meetings with the instructor
to review current progress and assess work to be completed over the next
week, (b) research on the tools, software, and visualization frameworks
upon which this project will be built, both explicitly during the initial
weeks, and during subsequent weeks to revisit and find information for
the particular tool being designed, (c) implementing the software, and
(d) writing the documentation.

It is expected this will take roughly 12 hours per week per student,
translating to 4 units of credit.
